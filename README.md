# Infekja
The macOS Malware Analyzer CLI Tool! üçé

Infekja is a macOS Malware Analyzer CLI Tool designed to streamline and simplify the process of examining potentially malicious macOS malware. By utilizing native macOS commands to analyze files and software, and enriching the gathered information through tools like VirusTotal, Infekja helps assess the likelihood of malicious behavior. To get started, simply point Infekja to the malicious app/binary you are investigating (e.g "python3 infekja.py analyze ~/Desktop/Malware/AMOS.dmg").
